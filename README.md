# Classification Medical appointment

One of the problems that medical clinics face is when a person books an appointment but does not show up. Every appointment that is not attended deprives another patient of the opportunity to benefit from it.

In this project, we will predict whether the patient will show or not, the aim is to help clinics in Brazil know if the clinic or the patient is responsible for this problem and understand the causes that led to it.
